# flowPay-Wallet
FlowPay-Wallet is a learning-focused system build in iterative sprints. Each sprint intentionally starts with a naive 
implementation that breaks under real-world conditions, followed by refactoring using proven backend engineering 
patterns.

## **Sprint 1**

Sprint 1 focuses on: 
* Setting up the project
* Transactions 
* Money Handling 
* Failing fast through tests

**Business Requirements:**

Funtional: 
* Create Wallet
* Deposit Money
* Retrieve Wallet balance

* Correct balance
* No negative balance
* Precision-safe money handling
